Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/hect1c/front-end-test.git

# Change directory
cd front-end-test

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

npm start

# Visit the following url in your preferred browser
http://localhost:3000

```

You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `npm start`. You can
download MongoDB [here](http://mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.

Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[mLab](https://mongolab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials
in `.env` file.
